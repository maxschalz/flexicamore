# Flexible Cycamore
This repository contains [Cyclus](https://github.com/cyclus/cyclus) archetypes,
strongly based on Cyclus' [Cycamore](https://github.com/cyclus/cycamore)
library.
These archetypes are designed to be more versatile by allowing input variables
to be time-dependent, e.g., the power output of a reactor can be configured to
change during the simulation.
This behaviour is implemented for few cases in Cycamore, and the goal of this
repository is to facilite the expansion of this behaviour to other variables.

This repository is developed by the
[Nuclear Verification and Disarmament group](https://www.nvd.rwth-aachen.de/)
from RWTH Aachen University, Germany.
