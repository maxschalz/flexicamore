# Flexible Cycamore
## input
This directory contains an example input file of a *very small* nuclear fuel
cycle composed of a uranium mine (`FlexibleSource`), a uranium enrichment
facility (`FlexibleEnrichment`) and two storages (`cycamore::Sink`), one for
enriched and one for depleted uranium.

The output file, `cyclus.sqlite`, and the output printed to the commandline,
`stdout_stderr.txt`, are provided for convenience and have been obtained using
the above-mentioned input file.
